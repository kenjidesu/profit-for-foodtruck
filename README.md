# profit-for-foodtruck
Predict profits for a food truck using Linear Regression with one variable or Univariate Linear Regression

# Dataset
The `'data1.txt'` contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

This exercise is from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This Assignment is originally written in MATLAB, but in this repository I converted it to Python.

# Algorithms Used
