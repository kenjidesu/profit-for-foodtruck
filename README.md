# profit-for-foodtruck
Predict profits for a food truck using Linear Regression with one variable or Univariate Linear Regression

# Dataset
The `'data1.txt'` contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

This exercise is from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This Assignment is originally written in MATLAB, but in this repository I converted it to Python.

# Use this Model to predict profits
- Make sure the dataset has only one variable.
- Data needs to be a csv or comma-separated value.
- The plots on this `.ipynb` may or may not work for some data since the `.ipynb` in this repo is customized for this dataset.
